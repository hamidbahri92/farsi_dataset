# Persian Language Teaching Dataset Generation Application

## Overview
This application uses the OpenAI API to generate a dataset for teaching the Persian language. It simulates a teacher-student interaction where the teacher (powered by GPT-4) provides Persian lessons, and the student (powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo) responds.

## Files
- `api_interaction.py`: Contains functions to generate teacher content and simulate student responses using OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo models.

## Setup
- Ensure you have the OpenAI Python library installed.
- Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it in the script.

## Usage
- Run the `api_interaction.py` script to start generating the dataset.
- The script uses GPT models to create a conversational dataset suitable for language teaching applications.
